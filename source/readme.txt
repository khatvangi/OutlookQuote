What' This:
-----------
This is an add-in (i.e. plug in) for Microsoft Outlook which would automatically insert a random quote at the end of your email alone with your signature.
This add-in also gives you ability to read your email in synthesized voice to you so that you can "hear" your email while working on something else!
